# Data importation

## Summary Datas

You can put the essential information of the project in an excel sheet with the name: **summary**
The system will consider that the first column corresponds to the name of an expected field and the following column will correspond to the value of this field.

## Specifications Datas

Metadatas :

| Metadata     | Description                                       |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Product-Type | Name of it node (have to same in other categories)|
| SubType      | Parent node                                       | 
| Category     | Type of component (AZA, LFP)                      |

Matrix of datas :

You only need to specify the point number, the data curve interpolation, the unit and one or more data in the column.
For the line of data, you need to specify the the starting date (only once, it will be calculate automaticly by the algorithme according to the point number)

## Models

All models are stored in web/media/models and can be downloaded via the web interface at http://localhost:8000/new_co

### Input Model (Operations and Constants)

These templates define the default constants and operations for a simulation.
If the specification files already have one of these operations, then it will be ignored and calculated as defined by the user.

The **constants** have the following format :

| Constant Category | Constant name | Value  | Unit  |
| ----------------- | ------------- |:------:| ----- |
| Dimensions        | Length        |  9.1   | cm    |

The **operations** have the following format:

| Composition name  | Operation name                   | Operation definition                                                 | Unit  |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------- |:--------------------------------------------------------------------:| ----- |
| Cell              | Nominal Capacity                 | { Weight } * [Energy Density (gravimetric)]                          | Wh    |
| BatteryPack       | Width                            | [Cell Quantity]*[Casing.Cell interspace]*[Cell.Width]+[Casing.Width] | mm    |
| BatteryPack       | Volume Overhead (Packs vs Cells) | {Cell.Energy density (volumetric)}/{Energy density (volumetric)}-1   |       |

Variables are defined by [name] and represent a specification to be provided by the user, [Composition_name.name] represents a variable present in Composition_name.

Functions are defined by {name} and represent a previously defined function in the current composition, {Composition_name.name} represents a function defined in Composition_name.

If the variable is not defined in the Excel sheet then the algorithm retrieves the values of the children multiplied by the quantity of children. This quantity is defined in the parent sheet with the following nomenclature : CHILD Quantity (1 by default).

The **filters** have the following format:

We can also add filters to function parameters that require a transformation:

| Filter unit | Filter name  | Filter function               |
| ------------| ------------ |:-----------------------------:|
| date        | Year         | Show the year of date         |
| date        | Month        | Show the month of date        |
| date        | Day          | Show the day of date          |

### Output Model

To define a value to display in the model, you just have to add a value such as [Composition_name/Function_name.name] in a cell and it will be automatically replaced by the system if it exists.

There are also operators to display certain types of data or in a certain shape. The style of the reference cell is automatically copied.

| Keyword Operator | Keyword Operator Description                                                             |
| -----------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
| FOR:             | Insert all data matrix in each row below                                                 |
| CATEGORY:        | Show data which belong to CATEGORY, all category cell values becomes a keyword operator  |


#### Unit Formatting System

It is an automatic system of formatting values according to their unit.

| Unit     | Unit Formatting Description                      |
| ---------|:------------------------------------------------:|
| date     | Format the date as Day/Month/Year                |
| $/â‚¬/cost | Format the monney number as XXX XXX.XX           |
| %        | Format any floating number with % unit as XX.XX% |
